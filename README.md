# sgdk-project-template

Basic Template to get started with using SGDK.

This was created, due to having issues with the Genesis Code vscode extension in late 2022.  It mimics what setting up a new project does with a simple git clone.  

Launching debug mode assumes you are using Gens+Kmod.  (It's what I am using)

# Usage
clone repo, cd into folder, run `d:\sgdk\bin\make.exe -f D:\sgdk\makefile.gen debug`, test ROM.

note:  The above command assumes you set up sgdk files in `d:\sgdk`

# todo
* Set SGDK Paths with variables in settings.json
* Set Emulator paths with variables in settings.json
* Set paths for Win, osx, Linux in settings.json, tasks.json and launch.json
